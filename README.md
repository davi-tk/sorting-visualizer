## Introduction

The study of algorithms one of the most popular areas of computer science, in which
many paths to accomplishing a specific task are tested and compared intending to achieve
the best performance possible. 

Hence, when considering the objective of sorting a list of values, there is a huge number of possible approaches, but, only a subset of these approaches have a good performance in
this task. Then, the purpose of this project is to help visualize some of the most known 
sorting algorithms work and observe how each of them operate and how fast they do it. 

## Features
1. Change the length of the list of values to be sorted from 10 to 150.
1. Change the speed in which the swaps will operate in (miliseconds).
1. Choose the sorting algorithm to be used.
1. Generate a new random list of values.
1. Initiate the operation of sorting the list.

## Setup
To run this project, clone it and install it locally using yarn.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/davi-tk/sorting-visualizer.git
$ cd ./sorting-visualizer
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
